== Pre-Requisites

=== Ansible Tower

You should have a solid understanding of the workflows and capabilities in Ansible Tower 3.

=== AWS

This lab is designed to run in AWS. It could also run in an OpenStack or even VMWare environment with minor modifications. However that is beyond today's scope. We are focusing on AWS, and assuming you know your way around.

[IMPORTANT]
.ASSUMPTIONS
====
It is assumed that you will have the following in AWS already:

* A user created with full admin roles
* A credit card to pay for the account
====

=== AWS environment

The bootstrap script will take an instance and configure Ansible Tower for you. However you will need to create the instance ahead of time and configure Tower.

[NOTE]
This is early on in the lifecycle of this lab. The plan is to automate most or all of this. But for right now there are still manual steps.

==== SSH Keys

==== Security Groups

==== Tower instance

For this lab, we will be using Ansible Tower 3.0.1, which is the latest production release. We are running it in an link:https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/[`m4.xlarge`] AWS instance.

This lab is NOT a walkthrough of Ansible Tower's setup. To be honest, it's too simple.

* get a system of correct size
* register it with Red Hat
* subscribe it to the proper channels
* download a tarball containing the Ansible setup scripts
* fill a few variables out in an inventory file
* run `setup.sh`

`setup.sh` just calls a playbook that deploys Ansible Tower. Total setup for this lab took approximately 45 minutes, end-to-end.

You know you were successful if you are able to browse to your Tower's hostname and get some like

To log in, you use the admin password you set in your inventory file. It's just that easy!
